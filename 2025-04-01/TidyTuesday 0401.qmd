## Running Code

```{r eval=TRUE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-04-01')
# View(tuesdata$pokemon_df)
pokemon<-tuesdata$pokemon_df
pokemon<-as.data.frame(pokemon)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  mutate(total_attack = attack + special_attack)%>%
  mutate(total_defense = defense + special_defense)%>%
  mutate(attack_defense_ratio=total_attack/total_defense)%>%
  mutate(special_attack_ratio=special_attack/total_attack)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(x = base_experience, y = total_attack, size = special_attack_ratio, color = attack_defense_ratio)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "What do more experienced Pokemon behave like?",
    subtitle = "Base Experience vs. Pokemon Attack",
    x = "Base Experience",
    y = "Total Attack",
    color = "Attack Defense Ratio",
    size = "Special Attack Ratio"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2, 10))+  # Adjust size range
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#9370DB", high = "#00BFFF") 
```

My research question is: What do more experienced Pokémon behave like? Are they more likely to prioritize attack over defense? When they attack, do they prefer special attacks over physical attacks?

From the graph, we can see that higher base experience leads to higher total attack. However, base experience doesn’t dominate the attack-defense ratio, as Pokémon generally favor attack over defense. Base experience also does not determine special attack preference.
